--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a starter roadmap:

1. Environment & Tooling Enhancements

CI/CD pipeline
Priority: High
Rationale: Automate builds/tests and catch errors early.

Next Steps:
Define GitHub Actions workflow to build Docker images and run tests.
Push images to a registry (Docker Hub/AWS ECR).
Environment parity
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Ensure “it works on my machine” disappears.

Next Steps:
Improve docker-compose.yml with separate dev/staging overrides.
Add health-checks and readiness probes for each service.

2. Code Architecture & Best Practices

Component structure
Priority: High
Rationale: Scalable folder layout reduces cognitive load.

Next Steps:
Introduce “feature-based” folders (/features/Auth, /features/Dashboard).
Co-locate tests, styles, and assets.
State management
Priority: High
Rationale: Centralized state avoids prop-drilling.

Next Steps:
Pick Redux Toolkit or Recoil based on team familiarity.
Scaffold slices/atoms for core domains (user, settings, data).
Styling approach
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Consistency and theming.

Next Steps:
Choose CSS-in-JS (e.g. Styled Components) or utility-first (Tailwind).
Set up a theming file and global styles.

3. Cross-Platform Mobile Integration (Expo-Focused)

Expo Managed Workflow
Priority: High
Rationale: Simplifies native config, OTA updates, and CI/CD with EAS.

Next Steps:
Install and configure the Expo CLI in your monorepo:
pnpm add -D expo-cli
Create an apps/mobile/app.json (or app.config.js) with your bundle identifiers, splash screens, and asset settings.
Verify you can run on device/emulator:
cd apps/mobile
expo start --tunnel
Dockerizing Expo
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Keeps your mobile dev environment consistent with backend services.

Next Steps:
Add an expo.Dockerfile alongside your existing /dockerfiles:
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY apps/mobile/package*.json ./
RUN pnpm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 19000 19001 19002
CMD ["pnpm", "turbo", "run", "dev", "--filter=apps/mobile"]

Update docker-compose.dev.yml to include the Expo service, linking to your API container.
API Integration & Environment
Priority: High
Rationale: Your mobile app needs access to auth, realtime, and REST endpoints.

Next Steps:
In apps/mobile, install your shared API client:
pnpm add @mindfield/api-client
Expose your backend in Docker on a fixed hostname (e.g. api.local) and add to app.json under extra or via .env:
extra: { API_BASE_URL: process.env.API_BASE_URL || "http://api.local:4000" }
Use expo-constants to read these at runtime.
Navigation & Routing
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Consistent UX across mobile and web.

Next Steps:
Install React Navigation and Expo dependencies:
pnpm add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
pnpm add react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
Scaffold a root stack in apps/mobile/src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx, and reuse layout in apps/web via React Native Web.
Over-the-Air Updates & Builds
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Streamlines distribution and patching without store releases.

Next Steps:
Set up EAS (Expo Application Services):
expo install eas-cli
eas login
Configure eas.json with your build profiles (development, preview, production).
Integrate an EAS build step into your CI pipeline for each push to main.
Native Module Considerations
Priority: Low
Rationale: Only if you need device-specific features.

Next Steps:
Audit for modules (e.g. camera, filesystem) and add via expo install.
Run expo prebuild only if you need to eject—otherwise stay in managed mode.

4. Testing Strategy

Unit tests
Priority: High
Rationale: Verify smallest units in isolation.

Next Steps:
Set up Jest + React Testing Library for components and hooks.
Integration tests
Priority: Medium
Rationale: API contracts must hold.

Next Steps:
Use MSW to mock your Docker-hosted APIs.
End-to-end
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Catch UI/workflow regressions.

Next Steps:
Choose Detox (native) or Playwright (web) and write smoke tests.

5. Deployment & Distribution

Web hosting
Priority: High
Rationale: Get staging/live environments up.

Next Steps:
Configure Vercel/Netlify to auto-deploy on push to main.
Integrate with your Docker registry for static builds.
Mobile app stores
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Preparation before first release.

Next Steps:
Set up Apple/Google developer accounts and provisioning profiles.
PWA considerations
Priority: Low
Rationale: Progressive enhancement for web.

Next Steps:
Add manifest.json, service worker, and offline caching.

6. Monitoring & Maintenance

Logging & error tracking
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Detect production issues quickly.

Next Steps:
Integrate Sentry or LogRocket in both web and native.
Performance monitoring
Priority: Low
Rationale: Optimize hotspots over time.

Next Steps:
Enable Web Vitals reporting and use React Profiler in dev builds.
Let me know your mobile‐framework choice, and I’ll tailor the “Cross-Platform” section further!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Steps:

Authentication Roadmap (Kong OIDC + Caddy)
Enable Kong’s OIDC Plugin
Add to your docker-compose.dev.yml under the Kong service:
services:
  kong:
    image: kong:3
    environment:
      KONG_DATABASE: "off"
      KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG: /etc/kong/kong.yml
    volumes:
      - ./kong/kong.yml:/etc/kong/kong.yml

In kong/kong.yml, configure the OIDC plugin:

_format_version: "2.1"
services:
  - name: api
    url: http://api:4000
    routes:
      - name: api-route
        paths: ["/api"]
        plugins:
          - name: openid-connect
            config:
              issuer: https://<YOUR-KEYCLOAK>/auth/realms/<realm>
              client_id: mindfield-client
              client_secret: <secret>
              redirect_uri: https://app.local/auth/callback
              introspection_endpoint: true

Configure Caddy as Reverse Proxy
In your Caddyfile:
app.local {
  reverse_proxy /api* kong:8000
}
caddy.local {
  reverse_proxy / auth-service:8080
  reverse_proxy /* web:3000
}
Ensure Caddy knows about Kong: add a network alias in Compose:
services:
  caddy:
    ...
    networks:
      default:
        aliases: [caddy.local, app.local]
  kong:
    ...
    networks:
      default:
        aliases: [kong]

Docker Compose Networking

Use a shared network so Caddy ↔ Kong ↔ API can talk by service name.

Example snippet:

networks:
  default:
    name: mindfield-net
Leverage Kong Admin API to Discover Services

Access via http://kong:8001/services to list registered services.

Script example (bash):

curl -s http://localhost:8001/services | jq '.data[] | {name, host, port}'

Document Available Endpoints

Point Swagger UI at Kong’s proxy:
In your NestJS Swagger setup, serve under /api/docs
Access via https://app.local/api/docs through Caddy→Kong.
Verify Authentication Flow
Visit https://app.local/api/secure-endpoint.
You should be redirected to Keycloak login, then back via /auth/callback.
Inspect JWT in request headers to API.

Next Steps

Define scopes/roles in Keycloak and map them in Kong’s OIDC plugin.
Add health-checks (/status) to Kong routes for uptime monitoring.
Write a small script or Postman collection to exercise each secured endpoint.
Let me know if you need sample Keycloak realm-configuration or further detail on scope mapping!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Validate & Parameterize Kong OIDC Setup

What I see: kong-configure bootstraps OIDC with hard-coded URLs (issuer: https://keycloak.aldous.info/…, redirect_uri: https://api.aldous.info/callback) via services/kong/configure.sh 
GitHub
.

Next:

Move issuer, client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri into your .env and render them in configure.sh (e.g. issuer=${OIDC_ISSUER}) so dev vs prod uses the right endpoints.

Add a health-check endpoint for your API (e.g. /healthz) and wire it into Kong’s depends_on and Caddy’s probes.

2. Refine Docker Compose Structure

What I see: A single docker-compose.yml lists 50+ services (backend/frontend/monitoring networks) 
GitHub
.

Next:

Split into layered files:

docker-compose.base.yml (core services: api, postgres, redis, kong)

docker-compose.dev.yml (dev-only: mailhog, minio, mkdocs)

docker-compose.monitoring.yml (observability: prometheus, grafana, otel-collector)

Use extends or -f flags to compose only what you need per environment.

3. Harden Caddy Reverse-Proxy

What I see: A one-liner Caddyfile routing all *.localhost to dozens of services 
GitHub
.

Next:

Break your dev Caddyfile into snippets or import blocks:

apps.caddy (web + mobile tunnel)

api.caddy (Kong + Keycloak)

monitoring.caddy (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, etc.)

Use environment placeholders ({$LOCAL_DOMAIN}) for easier overrides.

Enable request timeouts and circuit breakers on critical routes (reverse_proxy … { transport http { read_timeout 5s } }).

4. Document & Discover Available Services

What I see: The Compose & Caddy config list ~50 endpoints, but no single service registry.

Next:

Create a small “services.json” by curling Kong’s Admin API (http://kong:8001/services) in scripts/discover-services.sh.

Serve it via your Swagger UI or a simple React page under /services.

5. Security & Secrets Management

What I see: All env vars and secrets live in a single .env.

Next:

Migrate sensitive data (DB passwords, OIDC secrets) into Docker Secrets or HashiCorp Vault.

Update Compose to reference them via secrets: instead of raw .env.

These changes will ensure your OIDC flow works cleanly behind Caddy, your Compose remains maintainable, and you have a living directory of every service you’ve stood up.

Interaction Flow Explained

Clients (Web/Mobile) hit Caddy, which routes:

Static/web/UI (Next.js, Storybook)

/api traffic onward to Kong.

Kong applies OIDC (Keycloak) for auth, then forwards requests to services/api.

services/api (NestJS REST):

Invokes core/logic for real-time or background jobs (via BullMQ/Redis).

Reads/writes data in Postgres, caches in Redis, stores files in MinIO, and sends dev emails to Mailhog.

Uses Keycloak’s introspection endpoint to validate JWTs.

core/ui (Storybook) is served via Caddy for your component library and is independent of runtime traffic.

Observability: All runtime services emit traces/metrics to OTel Collector, which scrapes them into Prometheus; logs go to Loki; dashboards live in Grafana.

Service Discovery & Docs: You can curl Kong’s Admin API to list registered services and access Swagger UI under /api/docs through Caddy→Kong.

This architecture ensures clear separation between edge routing, auth, business logic, data stores, and observability—making it maintainable, secure, and scalable.

Edge & Routing

Caddy handles TLS and virtual‐host routing for web UIs, API traffic, and all ancillary tools via *.localhost rules 

API calls to /api go through Kong, which enforces OpenID Connect via Keycloak before proxying to services/api 

Authentication & API Gateway

Kong uses the OIDC plugin to validate tokens against Keycloak.

Authenticated requests are forwarded to services/api, injecting user claims into headers.

Primary Backend

services/api (NestJS) contains REST endpoints, delegates background jobs to core/logic (BullMQ/Redis) and real-time WS channels.

It uses PgBouncer for pooled Postgres connections and Redis for caching and job queuing.

Binary uploads and static assets are stored in MinIO; transactional emails go through Mailhog.

A scheduled backup service snapshots Postgres to ./database/backups.

GraphQL & Database Layers

Hasura and PostGraphile both auto-generate GraphQL APIs over the same Postgres schema, enabling rapid frontend prototyping or third-party integrations.

PII Processing Pipeline

Presidio Analyzer scans data for PII patterns (using Redis state).

Results flow into the Presidio Anonymizer, then into Presidio Image Redactor for any embedded images—forming a chained microservice pipeline.

Observability

Traces and metrics from the API, BullMQ workers, and Kong are collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector and sent to Prometheus (metrics) and Jaeger (traces).

Prometheus triggers alerts in Alertmanager; dashboards in Grafana visualize both metrics and logs (sourced via Loki and Promtail).

Node Exporter and Blackbox Exporter feed host-level and endpoint uptime metrics into Prometheus.

Developer & Admin UIs

pgAdmin, Prisma Studio, and Redis Insight provide DB and cache management.

OpenSearch Dashboards sits atop OpenSearch for log and full-text search analytics.

GrapesJS is a front-end content editor served via Caddy.

MkDocs serves project documentation at /docs.

Trivy runs container scans; results are accessible via its UI.

By grouping services into Edge, Auth/Gateway, Core, Data, Privacy, Observability, and Dev Tools, you can see end-to-end flows—from incoming requests through auth, business logic, data stores, to monitoring and backups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enable Kong OIDC behind Caddy

# extract OIDC config to .env
export OIDC_ISSUER=…
export OIDC_CLIENT_ID=…
export OIDC_SECRET=…
# update configure.sh and Caddyfile as before
Next Course of Action
Verify Local Auth Flow

Hit a protected endpoint (/api/secure) → redirected to Keycloak → back to API

Inspect JWT in headers

Stabilize Dev Environment

Split your Compose files (base, dev, monitoring)

Add health checks and readiness probes

CI/CD & Testing

# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
      - run: pnpm test
Add Jest + RTL unit tests

MSW for integration tests

Smoke E2E on a simple flow (login → fetch data)

Code Architecture & Docs

Adopt feature-based folders (/features/auth, /features/dashboard)

Co-locate types, tests, styles

Generate a live service registry via a small script and serve it under /services

Mobile & PWA Readiness

Once auth & API are stable, wire Expo mobile app to the same OIDC flow

Add a PWA manifest/service-worker to apps/web

Monitoring & Observability

Integrate Sentry for error tracking

Expose /metrics and scrap via Prometheus

Dashboards in Grafana

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s a concise, structured roadmap for your next phases:

1. Feature Integration & API Consumption
Priority: High
Rationale: Deliver end-user value by wiring UI to backend as services stabilize.
Tools/Patterns:

Shared API client (@mindfield/api-client) with OpenAPI-generated types

React Query for data fetching & caching

Feature slices (co-located components, hooks, tests)

Next Steps:

pnpm add @mindfield/api-client
Scaffold a /features/profile folder:

features/
  profile/
    ProfilePage.tsx
    profile.slice.ts
    profile.api.ts
    profile.test.tsx
In profile.api.ts:

import { createApi } from '@mindfield/api-client';
export const profileApi = createApi({ baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL })
  .injectEndpoints({ endpoints: (b) => ({
    getProfile: b.query<User, void>({ query: '/user/me' }),
  }) });
Hook into React Query:

export function useProfile() {
  return profileApi.useGetProfileQuery();
}
2. Advanced Security & Governance
Priority: High
Rationale: Harden production posture and enforce least-privilege.
Tools/Patterns:

RBAC/ABAC via Keycloak roles + Kong scope enforcement

Secret rotation (Vault or Docker Secrets)

Vulnerability scanning with Trivy in CI

Next Steps:

# GitHub Actions snippet: Trivy scan
- name: Scan containers
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.4.0
  with:
    image-ref: mindfield/api:latest
Define Keycloak roles (admin, user) and map to Kong plugin:

plugins:
  - name: openid-connect
    config:
      scopes: ["profile","email"]
      required_claims:
        resource_access:
          mindfield-client:
            roles: ["user","admin"]
3. Scalability & Performance Optimization
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Prepare for load growth and snappy UX.
Tools/Patterns:

Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes/ECS

CDN in front of Next.js (Vercel/CloudFront)

Redis caching & HTTP caching headers

Load testing with k6

Next Steps:

// k6 load test sketch
import http from 'k6/http';
export default function() {
  http.get(`${__ENV.API_URL}/api/items`);
}
Add Cache-Control in Next.js getServerSideProps:

res.setHeader('Cache-Control','public, max-age=60');
4. Developer Experience Enhancements
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Speed up onboarding & day-to-day dev.
Tools/Patterns:

Dev Containers (VSCode Remote)

GraphQL Codegen or OpenAPI codegen

Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit checks

Next Steps:

pnpm add -D @graphql-codegen/cli
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json with Docker Compose integration

codegen.yml for GraphQL types → hook into pnpm codegen

5. Data & Analytics Pipeline
Priority: Low
Rationale: Unlock metrics & insights from user activity.
Tools/Patterns:

Event streaming (Redis Streams or Kafka)

Data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake) via Airbyte

BI dashboard in Grafana or Superset

Next Steps:

Emit domain events in services/api (e.g., user.created) to Redis Stream.

Configure Airbyte to sync Postgres → warehouse.

Build Grafana dashboard panels on warehouse tables.

6. Release Management & Environment Promotion
Priority: Medium
Rationale: Smooth, predictable deployments across tiers.
Tools/tHub Environments (dev/staging/prod)

Semantic Release + @semantic-release/changelog

Blue/Green or Canary via Kubernetes

Next Steps:

# .github/workflows/release.yml
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*.*.*']
jobs:
  release:
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4
Define promotion policy: merge dev→staging, auto-deploy; manual approval for staging→prod.

7. Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loops
Priority: Low
Rationale: Iterate based on real usage and team feedback.
Tools/Patterns:

Feature flags (LaunchDarkly or Unleash)

In-app feedback (e.g., Sentry user feedback)

Post-mortem templates and quarterly retrospectives

Next Steps:

Integrate feature flags around new features:

import { useFlag } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';
const newUiEnabled = useFlag('new-ui');
Schedule quarterly “health checks” on performance, error rates, and backlog.

This roadmap ensures you build on your solid foundation and progressively add capabilities, guardrails, and feedback mechanisms. Let me know if you’d like deeper detail on any section!

You said:
I need to ensure that everything can be self-hosted for free without relying on paid services. I need to understand how authentication profiles schemas repositories services roles user management billing root cause analysis etc would be managed and delivered. All of this is before I even have an understanding of what the application will do, so I really need to ensure everything is configured as cheaply and generically as possible before I begin.

2. Kill Bill + OIDC Integration via Kong
Kill Bill doesn’t natively speak OIDC—front it with Kong’s OpenID-Connect plugin:

# docker-compose.yml (excerpt)
services:
  keycloak:
    image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:22.0.1
    # … your Keycloak setup …

  killbill:
    image: killbill/killbill:0.26
    environment:
      KILLBILL_DB_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/mindfield
      # … other Kill Bill env …
    ports: [“8082:8080”]
    depends_on: [“postgres”]

  kong:
    image: kong:3
    environment:
      KONG_DATABASE: "off"
      KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG: /etc/kong/kong.yml
    volumes:
      - ./kong/kong.yml:/etc/kong/kong.yml
    ports: [“8000:8000”]

# kong/kong.yml
_format_version: "2.1"
services:
  - name: killbill
    url: http://killbill:8080
    routes:
      - name: killbill-route
        paths: ["/billing"]
        plugins:
          - name: openid-connect
            config:
              issuer: https://keycloak.local/auth/realms/mindfield
              client_id: killbill-client
              client_secret: ${OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}
              redirect_uri: https://api.local/billing/callback
              introspection_endpoint: true
Keycloak realm: Create a killbill-client with appropriate roles (e.g. admin, accountant).

Kong OIDC plugin: Protect /billing/* paths; users must log in via Keycloak.

Kill Bill UI/API: Access it through Kong at https://api.local/billing.

With a public GitHub repo and GHCR-based images, plus a Kong‐fronted Kill Bill secured by Keycloak OIDC, you’ll have a fully self-hosted, free-to-operate billing & auth stack that’s open for external collaborators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Client->>Keycloak: /authorize?client_id=killbill-client&...
    Keycloak-->>Client: Login page (local or external IdP)
    Note over Client,Keycloak: User authenticates
    Keycloak-->>Client: 302 Redirect back with auth code
    Client->>Kong: /callback?code=abc123
    Kong->>Keycloak: POST /token (exchange code for tokens)
    Keycloak-->>Kong: { id_token, access_token, refresh_token }
    Kong->>Keycloak: (optional) introspect token
    Kong-->>Client: Set session cookie / proxy API call to backend
    Kong->>KillBill: GET /billing/invoices (with JWT in header)
    KillBill-->>Kong: 200 {invoices…}
    Kong-->>Client: 200 {invoices…}
Client requests a protected route on Kong.

Kong’s OIDC plugin redirects them to Keycloak’s /authorize.

Keycloak presents login—either its own user database or an external IdP you’ve configured.

After successful login, Keycloak issues an authorization code, which Kong exchanges at /token for JWTs.

Kong introspects or verifies the JWT, then proxies the request (with the token) to Kill Bill.

Kill Bill sees a valid JWT and serves data according to the user’s roles/claims.

2. Federating External IdPs in Keycloak
Keycloak supports identity brokering—you can add Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., as “Identity Providers.” Users then log in to Keycloak with those credentials.

In the Keycloak Admin UI → Realm → Identity Providers

Add Provider: choose Google

Enter your Google OAuth Client ID & Secret

Set “Default Scope” (e.g. openid email profile)

Repeat for Facebook, Apple, etc.

Configure Mappers so that external attributes map into Keycloak tokens:

In the Identity Provider settings → Mappers

Map email → email claim

Map given_name → given_name claim, etc.

User Flow

On login, users can click “Log in with Google/Facebook/Apple”

Keycloak handles the federated OAuth flow, then issues its own JWTs downstream.

3. Integrating with Kill Bill
Protect Kill Bill UI/API via Kong:

# kong/kong.yml excerpt
services:
  - name: killbill
    url: http://killbill:8080
    routes:
      - paths: ["/billing"]
        plugins:
          - name: openid-connect
            config:
              issuer: https://<KEYCLOAK_HOST>/realms/<REALM>
              client_id: killbill-client
              client_secret: ${OIDC_SECRET}
              scopes: ["openid","profile","email"]
              introspection_endpoint: true
Role & Permissions

In Keycloak → Clients → killbill-client → Roles: define roles like account_admin, account_user.

Assign these roles to users or groups (local or federated users).

Kong will reject requests lacking the required roles/scopes.

Passing Customer Parameters

Users authenticate via Keycloak and arrive at Kill Bill with a JWT carrying their sub, email, and assigned roles.

Your fng) can append extra URL/query parameters or headers before proxying—e.g.:

GET /billing/customers?region=EU HTTP/1.1
Host: api.local
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Kill Bill’s REST API can read these parameters to filter invoices, apply locale-specific billing rules, etc.

4. Putting It All Together
Keycloak = central identity with local users + external IdP brokering

Kong OIDC plugin = gateway enforcement, token issuance/validation

Kill Bill = protected billing API/UI, consuming the JWT claims

External IdP support = simply configured in Keycloak’s Identity Providers

Customer parameters = sent as normal request params/headers alongside the JWT

With this setup, you can onboard customers via Google/Facebook/Apple (or any OIDC/OAuth2 IdP), have Keycloak unify their profiles and roles, enforce access at the Kong layer, and let Kill Bill serve billing data based on those authenticated identities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a high-level design and step-by-step plan for metering service-level usage and feeding it into Kill Bill for invoicing:

1. Define Billable “Units” in Kill Bill
In your Kill Bill catalog (XML or via the UI) declare a unit for each kind of usage, e.g.:

<usages>
  <unit name="api_call"/>
  <unit name="storage_gb"/>
  <unit name="email_sent"/>
  <!-- add one per billable feature/service -->
</usages>

<plans>
  <plan name="API-Monthly">
    <fixed price="0.00"/>
    <recurring price="0.00"/>
    <usage>
      <unitName>api_call</unitName>
      <billingPeriod>MONTHLY</billingPeriod>
    </usage>
  </plan>
  <!-- define tiers/prices per unit as needed -->
</plans>
2. Instrument Your Services to Emit Usage Events
Whenever a user invokes a billable service or function, emit a “usage event” into your existing queue infrastructure (BullMQ + Redis):

// in services/api (NestJS controller or interceptor)
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';
const billingQueue = new Queue('billing-usage', { connection: redisConfig });

await billingQueue.add('recordUsage', {
  accountId: user.accountId,        // from JWT via Kong/Keycloak
  unitType: 'api_call',             // matches Kill Bill unit name
  quantity: 1,                      // increment count
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  metadata: { service: 'services/api', endpoint: '/widgets' }
});
3. Build a “Billing-Usage” Worker to Ingest into Kill Bill
In your core/logic service (or a new microservice), consume that queue and call Kill Bill’s Usage API:

import { Worker } from 'bullmq';
import axios from 'axios';

const killbill = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.KILLBILL_URL, 
  auth: { username: process.env.KB_USER, password: process.env.KB_PASS }
});

new Worker('billing-usage', async job => {
  const { accountId, unitType, quantity, timestamp } = job.data;
  await killbill.post('/1.0/kb/usages', {
    accountId,
    unitType,
    amount: quantity,
    usageDate: timestamp
  }, {
    headers: { 'X-Killbill-ApiKey': process.env.KB_API_KEY }
  });
});
Priority: High

Rationale: real-time, reliable ingestion

4. (Optional) Backfill via Metrics Polling
If you prefer pulling from Prometheus instead of per-request events, run a daily job:

import { PrometheusDriver } from 'prometheus-query';
import { Queue } from 'bullmq';

const prom = new PrometheusDriver({ endpoint: 'http://prometheus:9090' });
const billingQue('billing-usage', { connection: redisConfig });

const res = await prom.customQuery(
  `sum by (accountId) (increase(http_requests_total[24h]))`
);

for (const { metric, value } of res) {
  const accountId = metric.accountId;
  await billingQueue.add('recordUsage', {
    accountId,
    unitType: 'api_call',
    quantity: Number(value),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
Priority: Medium

Rationale: easy aggregation if instrumenting every endpoint is too heavy

5. Tie Usage to Customer Accounts & Plans
Keycloak → Kong → services/api flow gives you accountId in each request via the JWT.

Ensure your usage events carry that same accountId.

In Kill Bill, assign each accountId a subscription to the appropriate plan (e.g. API-Monthly).

6. Expose Usage & Billing Data in Your UI
Invoice history & upcoming usage: use Kill Bill’s REST API under /1.0/kb/invoices and /1.0/kb/usages to show customers their consumption.

Dashboard: Wire Grafana to your Postgres (Kill Bill schema) to build real-time usage charts per service/unit.

7. Next Steps Summary
Catalog setup: define units & plans in Kill Bill.

Event emission: add usage‐event calls in each billable service/function.

Worker ingestion: consume events → Kill Bill Usage API.

Backfill (opt): periodic Prometheus poll for aggregate usage.

Customer UI: fetch and display usage/invoices.

Testing: simulate usage, validate invoices appear correctly (use Kill Bill sandbox).

This architecture keeps all billing logic self-hosted, leverages your existing Redis/BullMQ pipeline, and maps cleanly into Kill Bill’s usage-based billing model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

🔌 1. Third-party payment processors
✅ Kill Bill does not process credit cards directly — instead, it integrates with payment gateways.
Out of the box (via plugins or API integrations), it supports:

Stripe

Adyen

Braintree

PayPal

WorldPay

Authorize.net

Many others (full list: Kill Bill plugins)

👉 You configure Kill Bill to handle:

customer profiles

payment methods

subscriptions, usage, invoices

…and delegate the actual charge (card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, ACH) to the gateway.

🌐 2. OIDC + Google sign-in
✅ You can allow Google sign-in via Keycloak OIDC → authenticate the user → map to a Kill Bill account.
But: Kill Bill does not handle login or auth itself; that stays external (e.g., Keycloak + Kong).

Typical flow:

User signs in via Google → Keycloak → JWT to API → resolve Kill Bill accountId

Service usage tracked + billed → Kill Bill account

Payments processed → Stripe or other gateway linked to Kill Bill

💳 3. Handling customer disputes (overcharge, no service, refund)
This is where Kill Bill shines for enterprise-level operations:

✅ Kill Bill ount lifecycle: see all subscriptions, invoices, payments, adjustments

Dispute management API: apply credits, void payments, issue refunds

Audit trail: track who/when/what at every stage (even manual ops)

Custom fields & tags: attach metadata (e.g., “VIP,” “Fraud Watch,” “Beta Tester”)

Plugins or direct DB access: allow building a custom agent UI for CS teams

BUT:

❗ You need to build or integrate the customer service UI.
Kill Bill provides the data + admin API but no fancy “Zendesk-like” dashboard out of the box.

🏦 4. Enterprise billing patterns & features
✅ Supports:

One-time purchases, subscriptions, usage-based billing, metered plans

Discounts, coupons, promotions

Invoicing + payment retries + dunning

Tax handling (with plugins)

Multi-currency

⚠️ 5. Typical issues & challenges to manage
Issue	Kill Bill Feature or Solution
“I didn’t get service”	Check usage logs, subscription state, invoice items; apply adjustments if needed
“I was overcharged”	Review invoice, apply credit, adjust subscription
“Card was charged after I canceled”	Use Kill Bill’s cancellation + refund flow; ensure integration respects cancellation
Regulatory compliance (GDPR, PCI)	Store sensitive data only at gateway (e.g., Stripe), not inside Kill Bill
You own the integration layer to:

sync user activity to billing

track service delivery → correlate with invoices

expose this data to agents or customers

🛠️ What you need to plan for
✅ Build:

Agent dashboard (or integrate Kill Bill admin UI)

Customer portal (for invoices, payments, downloads)

Service tracking hooks to log actual delivery (so you can prove “yes, they used 1,000 API calls”)

💡 Summary
✅ Kill Bill can power enterprise-level, dispute-resilient billing, with Stripe/Adyen/etc. integrations
✅ You can authenticate via Google (OIDC)
✅ You must build:

the glue between user auth & billing account

the service usage tracking pipeline

the agent + customer-facing tools for billing visibility

C. Additional Enterprise Considerations
Rate-Limiting & Tier-Plans – implement Kong rate-limiting-advanced plugin tied to Kill Bill plan IDs.

Plugin Marketplace – expose a Helm-chart repo so third-party services can “snap-in” (similar to Supabase extensions).

Partner Integrations – webhooks & OAuth clients for Slack, Zapier, Salesforce.

Data Residency – multi-region buckets & per-tenant encryption keys.

Compliance Tooling – OpenPolicyAgent for infra policies; Tern or Trivy for license scans.

A/B Experimentation – PostHog feature flags gating React components.

Edge CDN – optional BYO: Cloudflare R2 + Workers (still free tier-friendly).

Follow the phases sequentially—each builds safely on the last while keeping the entire stack 100 % open-source and cost-neutral.

module "ec2_cluster" {
  source        = "./modules/ec2_k3s"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  count         = var.node_count
}

output "k3s_server_ips" {
  value = module.ec2_cluster.server_ips
}
Example GitHub Actions CD (.github/workflows/cd.yml):

restore:
    age -d -i keys/private.key -o backup.tgz.enc | tar xz
    velero restore create --from-schedule daily-full
    # restore DB
    psql -h pg -U mindfield < backup/sql/dump.sql
Health Probe example (infrastructure/k3s/health.yaml):

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: { name: health-check }
spec:

5. Key Management & Security
Objectives:
Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in Git; enforce least privilege.

Tools: HashiCorp Vault, Sealed-Secrets, cert-manager

Deliverables:

secrets-templates/vault-policies.hcl

K8s SealedSecret examples

cert-manager Issuer/Certificate CRDs

Vault policy example (secrets-templates/vault-policies.hcl):

path "secret/data/mindfield/*" {
  capabilities = ["create","read","update","delete","list"]
}

6. Business Continuity Plan & Runbooks
Objectives:
Document roles, RTO/RPO, and step-by-step ops for failover:

docs/runbook.md with play-by-play failover

RTO/RPO table

On-call rota template

Runbook snippet (docs/runbook.md):

### DR Playbook

1. **Alert**: On Velero backup failure → PagerDuty  
2. **Assess**: Check last successful backup timestamp  
3. **Provision**: `make deploy` on new VM/cluster  
4. **Decrypt**: `make restore`  
5. **Verify**: Run health-check pod; check Sentry for errors
7. Documentation & Onboarding
Objectives:
Auto-generate guides, API docs, and diagrams for rapid contributor enablement.

Tools: MkDocs with Material theme, Diagrams.net exports

Deliverables:

mkdocs.yml config in docs/

Automated site build in GitHub Pages

Sequence & architecture diagrams

MkDocs config (docs/mkdocs.yml):

site_name: Mindfield Infra
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Architecture: architecture.md
  - Runbooks: runbook.md
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocs-gen-files
